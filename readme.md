This is a 'sobriety clock'. It tracks how many days you've been sober, and how much money you've saved by not drinking.

So, I needed this thing and nobody had it, so I cobbled it together using free examples, modifying things here or there.

I don't care what you do with it.


Basic use

var date1 = new Date("1/01/2018");
Replace 1/01/2018 with your sober date, it's Month, Day, Year

To change how much money you've saved,
$<script>var num = (diffDays * 24.97); var n = num.toFixed(2); document.write(n);</script> USD
Replace 24.97 with however much money you would spend on alcohol per day. (Maker's Mark is 24.97 at Walmart, and I could put AT LEAST one of those away, each night.)
